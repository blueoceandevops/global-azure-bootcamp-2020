Stefan is a senior Cloud Architect with a 20 yearsâ€™ experience in running IT. In the last years, he focused on Hybrid Cloud Solutions, because these are the solutions which are most complex and variety is the maximum.
This is the field he feels comfortable. As he started with networking staff like configuring Cisco Routers and later with MS Biztalk Server bringing Business Processes to modern environments, the bandwidth is perfect for Hybrid Solutions.
The latest projects were all based on Microsoft Azure and local Environments like Azure Pack or even now on Azure Stack.
His blog can be found at [https://blog.denninger.at](https://blog.denninger.at/) or on Twitter [@stefandenninger](https://twitter.com/stefandenninger) 

Since April 2018 he is also awarded to be an Microsoft Regional Director ;)
